# Learning-TensorFlow

This repository contains notebook in which I've practiced TensorFlow 2.0 following the [Daniel Bourke's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCFfeUEGs8&t=23192s&ab_channel=DanielBourke). The idea for this repository is to hold anything which would serve me as a quick reference when it comes to TensorFlow 2.0.
